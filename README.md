# WG Character Poll

## Disclaimer
As this the first time using both React and creating a twitch extension, I did an effort on providing some code using help from twitch's documentation and some of the extension codes available on github to see how it works. I got the knowledge on how to setup an extension for twitch (and the importance of the twitch's helper script).

## Design Ideas
The concept was going to be simple, the streamer should be able to just set the time for the poll and launch it, and then see the results as character name and number of votes if votes are > 0.
For the viewer, once the streamer starts the poll, they have x amount of seconds to vote by clicking on the portrait of their favourite character (in this example I am using Dota 2's portraits).
And then rince and repeat when needed,

## Improvements
The main improvement I would like to see, is a search bar for the viewer, as MOBAs usually have a few dozens of characters scrolling shouldn't be enough.
As an incentive to sub, maybe subbed viewers can cast votes twice, or their votes can be counted with a higher coefficient, or use bits to cast extra votes.
Include a mobile version, and maybe instead of panel use video-component? or use chat input as an option as well?
Actually make the extension work... as right now it is not really functional...
